/* This is a configuration file for commitlint, a tool used to enforce consistent commit message
formatting in a project. The file sets several rules for commit messages, such as the maximum length
of the header and body, the required case for the body, and the allowed types of commits. The
severity of each rule is also specified, with some rules issuing warnings and others issuing errors.
The configuration file is exported using `module.exports` so that it can be used by commitlint. */

/**
 * * The first value is a number that expresses the severity of the rule:
  0: the rule is disabled;
  1: show a warning;
  2: itâ€™s an error.
